title: FoCo Girls Who Code and Pi's
---

Yesterday I participated in another successful demonstration of the RGB Slider with some Pi's. This one was with a wonderful group Fort Collins Girls Who Code. 

Full Code and Doc (+ presentation): [https://github.com/idcrook/rpi-hw-js-demo](https://github.com/idcrook/rpi-hw-js-demo)


Thanks to Alison of Girls Who Code for sending some photos she grabbed during it that I've shared below.

Got it working!
