title: Wireframes for Octotrol
---

Using Notability app on iPad, annotated "wireframes" for main app tabs.

Have four tabbed views in mind:

 1. Controls
    - Head movement
    - Manual temp controls
 1. Files
    - Select "active" file
    - File name and size
 1. Job Status
    - ETA, numericals on active print
 1. Settings 
   - Network settings
