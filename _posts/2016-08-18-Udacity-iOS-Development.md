title: iOS App Dev class from Udacity
---

Will be blogging on [How to Make an iOS App](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud607/) Udacity course.

I was planning on creating/updating an [iOS native app](https://github.com/idcrook/OctoControl-iOS) for [OctoPrint](http://octoprint.org/), intending to bring to iOS 10. OctoPrint is "The snappy web interface for your 3D printer."

Some implementation details/goals:

 - Xcode 8+
 - Swift 3.0
 - Use [OctoPi](https://octopi.octoprint.org/) controlling a [LulzBot Mini](https://www.lulzbot.com/store/printers/lulzbot-mini) to test on real-world hardware.

Stay tuned for more...
