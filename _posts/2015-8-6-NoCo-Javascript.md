title: NoCo Javascript Meetup
---

I have been going to a
[local meetup](http://www.meetup.com/NoCo-JavaScript-Meetup/) for Javascript,
and it has been been well-attended and fun.  There is another event coming up
in August (two in one month!).

Incidentally Yours Truly is putting together a presentation for October. It
should be interesting.


## Summary

If you are in Northern Colorado like Fort Collins or Loveland and have interest
in learning about the local Javascript community, you should check
(http://www.meetup.com/NoCo-JavaScript-Meetup/) out.  We have once-monthly
meetings, and the organizer Jeff is a great guy.
