title: Atlas 3D scanner is a fun project
---

Got my [Atlas 3D Scanner](/images/first_scan_in_progress.jpg) built.

## What is it?

It is a
[Kickstarter project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1545315380/atlas-3d-the-3d-scanner-you-print-and-build-yourse)
that put together kit for a line-scanning 3D scanner.

In some of the reward variants, you bring your own mechanicals printed with a
3D printer, and then use those to house the components and provide structural
makeup.  This is the reward I chose when backing.

It runs the software on a Raspberry Pi, and you connect to it and control it
over a network too!

### What was great

The 3d parts that were designed by
[Murobo LLC](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1545315380/atlas-3d-the-3d-scanner-you-print-and-build-yourse/creator_bio)
all printed well in ABS the first time.  Some of the highest quality 3D models
lineup I have come across.

The KS creator provided timely, informative communications and kept to schedule
(minus some supplier issues which were quickly resolved).  Support for the
backers has been so great!

The software (also included as part of the kickstarter project for backers)
runs excellent on a Raspbery Pi 2 model B.

Plus, there are friggin laser beams.

## Summary

Overall, the best KS experience I have had.

Some parts of the assembly were tricky the first time through.  It might have been helpful had I a helper with tiny fingers for a few of the steps, but overall it is a a robust mechanical design.

It has been a fun, rewarding experience so far, and I am looking forward to
calibration fine-tuning and getting some scans out there.
