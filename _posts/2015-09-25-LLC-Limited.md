title: Starting on my LLC
---

I formed an LLC a while ago to be able to easily contract or subcontract on
some of my new activities. Anyway, I needed the legal entity to simplify
things... but I never really did anything for branding.

## Hackering logo

I had an idea for a logo that had to do with seven segment LED displays. My
first Raspberry Pi project-- it is still chugging away; I need to write a post
about it-- includes two 1.2" seven-segment display for the time/temp. It is
visible from most of my house, and has been running reliably since its
inception.

I started googling for seven-segment display and `inkscape` or `gimp`, and
behold! there was an online
[screencast tutorial](http://screencasters.heathenx.org/episode-065/) for doing
basically exactly what I was thinking, using `inkscape`.

So here I present for your approval my brand new brand:


![brand](/images/small_gesture_hero.png)

It is an **S** and a **G** from the name of the LLC: "Small Gesture".  I like
how it includes old-school, reliable hardware component representations.

## Improvements

I plan to increase my personal brand around getting toward some more software
consultancy in the coming days.

I am also starting a
[Foundations of Data Science](https://www.mysliderule.com/workshops/data-science)
workshop next week, so I might expect to become more serious on that topic, and
perhaps even include some course projects in this space.  Looking forward!
