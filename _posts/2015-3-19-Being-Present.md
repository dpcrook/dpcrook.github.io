title: Being present

Years ago, I hosted a personal weblog with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/).
The [Debian GNU/Linux](https://www.debian.org/) system it was hosted on served
me well for about nine years (~2000-2008).  In
fact, it was [based on an Intel chipset](http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/highlights/dsktpboards/d850gb)
that I worked on for my first job at [Intel Corporation](https://www.intel.com).

I hosted blog pages of a personal nature mostly, and also used to host/share
pictures with [Gallery 2](http://codex.galleryproject.org/Gallery2:Download) software.

I took it down at some point and gradually stopped maintaining an external
web-server.  I had started experimenting with Blogger sites and included posts of a
technical nature, but I never really stayed disciplined with those.  

This was all before twitter or Facebook or GitHub pervasiveness.  And even Google
appeared along the way.  Step up to today.

I plan to use my [GitHub people page](https://dpcrook.github.io) to share
developer or technical entries and as my contact homepage.  So here it is!
